            <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
            <p>
                Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather
                patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun's activity
                or large volcanic eruptions.

                But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main cause of climate
                change, primarily due to carbon emissions, deforestation, manufacturing,
                and energy production. These activities increase greenhouse gases such as
                carbon dioxide and methane.

            <h3>Causes of Climate Change</h3>
            <p>
                Fossil fuels — coal, oil, and gas — are the largest contributors to global
                climate change, responsible for over 75% of greenhouse gas emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emissions trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. The
                world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history.

        <h2>Humans are responsible for global warming</h2>
        <p>Climate scientists have shown that humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years.</p>

        <div class="callout callout-warm" role="note" aria-label="Key temperature stat">
            <strong>Now:</strong> Earth's surface is ~<b>1.2°C</b> warmer than the late 1800s; each of the last four decades has been warmer than any decade since 1850.
        </div>

        <p>The average temperature of the Earth's surface is now about 1.2°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s 
            (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2011-2020) 
            was the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850.</p>
        <p>The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires, rising 
            sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.</p>

        <h2>Global temperature in 2024</h2>
        <p>According to the annual report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2024 was the warmest year since global records began in 1850. The global average surface temperature was 2.32 Fahrenheit (1.29°C) above the 20th-century average and 2.63°F (1.46°C) above the pre-industrial average (1850–1900).</p>

        <h2>People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways</h2>
        <p>Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries...</p>

        <h2>Every increase in global warming matters</h2>
        <p>Limiting warming to no more than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst impacts. Yet current policies point to as much as 3.1°C by 2100. The six biggest emitters together account for over half of global emissions, while the 45 least developed countries produce only ~3%.</p>

            <summary>Advancements in Carbon Capture Technology</summary>
            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Carbon capture technology refers to processes and tools to reduce CO₂ emissions from atmospheric levels or stop industrial emissions. This innovative solution focuses on industries such as power, manufacturing, and transportation, which are recognized as some of the most polluting sectors. 
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore, as the world shifts to a green economy, it will become possible to tackle climate change by capturing CO² before it is released into the atmosphere.
                    <br><br>
                    By 2025, carbon capture technologies like Direct Air Capture (DAC), led by companies like Climeworks, are set to improve in efficiency and cost. BECCS (Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) and carbon mineralization, where CO₂ forms solid carbonates, are emerging as key solutions. Companies like Carbfix are advancing permanent carbon storage, contributing to negative emissions and climate change mitigation.

            <summary>AI and Machine Learning in Climate Technology</summary>
            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>AI and ML are key drivers of innovation in climate tech trends, offering data-driven solutions for weather forecasting, energy management, and renewable energy use. They process large datasets from satellites and sensors to monitor deforestation, glacier melting, and urban heat islands, aiding in climate change mitigation.
                    <br><br>
                    By 2025, AI technologies are expected to help tackle climate issues, with predictive analytics enabling better preparation for extreme weather events. Companies like IBM and Google are developing systems to monitor emissions and resource use in unprecedented detail. In agriculture, ClimateAI aids crop production with less water and fertilizer. AI applications like AutoGrid and Grid.io optimize energy grids, balancing supply and demand while enhancing storage for renewable energy.
                    <br><br>
                    Carbon Trail’s AI Copilot, for example, uses machine learning to simplify sustainability strategies in fashion by automating life cycle assessments and predicting environmental impacts—approaches that can be adapted across industries to make climate data actionable

            <summary>Electrification of Transport and Green Mobility</summary>
            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) are leading the shift towards sustainable transportation, with global sales expected to rise by 2025 as companies like Tesla, BYD, and Volkswagen ramp up production. Advances in solid-state batteries are making EVs more effective and accessible. Hydrogen-powered vehicles, such as the Toyota Mirai and Hyundai NEXO, are gaining popularity for freight transport, offering a cleaner alternative to diesel vehicles. 
                    <br><br>
                    In California, the Zero Emission Truck and Bus Pilot Project plans to deploy 100 hydrogen fuel cell trucks by 2025. Beyond cars, electric delivery vans and ammonia-powered cargo ships are also being developed to reduce emissions in other sectors.

            <summary>Circular Economy and Waste Reduction Innovations</summary>
            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>The circular economy is a system that deals with the efficient use of resources for as long as possible. It focuses on creating products that are designed to be long-lived, easily repairable and recyclable so that less demand is made for virgin materials. This has the advantage over traditional approaches in saving waste and emission of greenhouse gases. For example, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation predicts that circular economy practices in key sectors such as plastics and textiles could bring global CO₂ emissions cut by 45% by 2050.
                    <br><br>
                    At its core, the circular economy promotes a shift in mindset: emerging as a way of managing and processing waste as a valuable commodity instead of a nuisance. Anything from turning plastic bottles into clothing to mining valuable metals from discarded electronics, there are always opportunities for innovation.

            <summary>Smart Agriculture and Climate-Resilient Food Production</summary>
            <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>Climate-smart agriculture will depend on innovations in crop breeding and management practices by 2025. There are new and improved crops that have been genetically or ecologically modified to adapt to conditions of low water supply and water stress and these improvement have been meeting the needs of rain starved farmers. To illustrate this, biologists in Kenya have bio-engineered crops that survive drought and produce between 20-30 % more than normal crops in such times.
                    <br><br>
                    Another such instance of innovation is vertical farming, where crops are raised in enclosed structures with controlled lighting and grown hydroponically. Businesses such as AeroFarms are now driving this kind of innovation, growing leafy greens that use 95% less water and no pesticides. At the same time, the use of the trees alongside crops, known as agroforestry, maintains soil productivity. It also assists the farmer to mitigate the impact of heat caused by climate change.
