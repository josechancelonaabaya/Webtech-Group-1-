        <h2 id="intro">Climate Change</h2>
        <p>
          Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. 
          Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. 
          Human activities, however, are the main drivers today, increasing greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="causes-effects">
        <h2 id="causes-effects">Causes and Effects of Climate Change</h2>
        <p>
          Fossil fuels – coal, oil, and gas – are the largest contributor to global climate change, 
          accounting for over 75% of greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. 
          These emissions trap the sun’s heat, leading to global warming and disrupting the balance of nature.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section aria-labelledby="causes">
        <h2 id="causes">Causes of Climate Change</h2>
        <h3>Fossil Fuel Power Plants</h3>
        <p>
          Burning coal, oil, and gas in energy, transportation, and industry increases greenhouse gases, 
          trapping heat and raising Earth’s temperature.
        </p>
        <h3>Manufacturing Goods</h3>
        <p>
          From extraction of materials to production and transport, manufacturing releases greenhouse gases, 
          often relying on fossil fuels.
        </p>
        <h3>Deforestation</h3>
        <p>
           Cutting forests releases stored carbon dioxide and reduces the planet’s ability to absorb emissions. 
           Around 12 million hectares are destroyed annually.
        </p>
        <h3>Transportation</h3>
          <p>
            Most vehicles burn fossil fuels, making transport a major source of emissions. 
            Road vehicles, planes, and ships significantly contribute to carbon dioxide levels.
          </p>
        <h3>Food Production</h3>
        <p>
          Agriculture contributes through land clearing, livestock digestion, fertilizer use, and energy consumption, 
          making it a major source of methane and carbon dioxide.
        </p>
        <h3>Buildings</h3>
        <p>
          Residential and commercial buildings consume over half of electricity, much of it generated from fossil fuels, 
          contributing to rising emissions.
        </p>
        <h3>Consumption</h3>
        <p>
          Household energy use, diet, waste, and product consumption all contribute to emissions. 
          The wealthiest 1% account for more greenhouse gases than the poorest 50%.

      <section aria-labelledby="effects">
        <h2 id="effects">Effects of Climate Change</h2>
        <h3>Hotter Temperatures</h3>
        <p>
          Each decade since the 1980s has been warmer than the last, increasing risks of heat-related illness, 
          wildfires, and Arctic warming.
        </p>
        <h3>More Severe Storms</h3>
        <p>
          Warmer oceans intensify storms, causing flooding, destruction, and economic losses.
        </p>
        <h3>Increased Drought</h3>
        <p>
          Water scarcity, crop failures, and ecosystem stress are becoming more frequent due to climate change.
        </p>
        <h3>Rising Seas</h3>
        <p>
          Oceans absorb most of the excess heat, expand, and rise due to melting ice, threatening coastal communities.
        </p>
        <h3>Loss of Species</h3>
        <p>
          One million species are at risk of extinction, accelerated by extreme weather, pests, and habitat loss.
        </p>
        <h3>Food Security</h3>
        <p>
          Extreme weather, ocean acidification, and loss of arable land are undermining global food systems.
        </p>
        <h3>Health Risks</h3>
        <p>
          Climate change worsens air pollution, disease spread, malnutrition, and disaster-related health crises.
        </p>
        <h3>Poverty and Displacement</h3>
        <p>
          Millions are displaced annually by climate-related disasters, deepening poverty and vulnerability.

        <p>
          Humans are responsible for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. 
          Earth’s surface is now about 1.2°C warmer than in the late 1800s, 
          with the last decade being the hottest on record. 
          Consequences include droughts, floods, fires, rising seas, and biodiversity loss.
